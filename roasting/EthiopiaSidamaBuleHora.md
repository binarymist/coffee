|------------|-----|--|-------
| 2020-11-03 | 1.4 |  | There are fruit & floral hints masked by green & sour flavours. Potential is there for a better (probably slower to heat) roast profile
| 2020-07-05 | 2.0 |  | Not quite as good as 3.0
| 2020-11-03 | 2.1 |  | Not tasting any wow factor here<br>Not as much potential flavour here as below 2.0
| 2020-08-12 | 2.3 |  | Similar to 2.5
| 2020-07-26 | 2.5 |  | Some really nice flavours appear in this range. A blend of somewhere around 2.3 - 2.5 and something darker would probably be pretty good
| 2020-07-26 | 2.8 |  | No noticable difference from 2.5
| 2020-07-05 | 3.0 |  | Pretty good tasting, not that many different taste notes though
| 2020-08-12 | 3.5 |  | Starting to taste charcoal

| 3.2 (default) | 2020-11-28 | Weak tasting, little flavour at all<br>2nd cup was considerably better, not sure why, may have been espresso machine heat<br>Would try going lighter though.<br>Taste will probably get better up to a week, as some of the floral taste notes do start to appear to several days out from roast.
