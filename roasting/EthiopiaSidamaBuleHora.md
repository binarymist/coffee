# K-logic classic

| Roast | Date       | Comments |
|-------|------------|-------
| 1.4   | 2020-11-03 | There are fruit & floral hints masked by green & sour flavours. Potential is there for a better (probably slower to heat) roast profile
| 2.0   | 2020-07-05 | Not quite as good as 3.0
| 2.1   | 2020-11-03 | Not tasting any wow factor here<br>Not as much potential flavour here as below 2.0
| 2.3   | 2020-08-12 | Similar to 2.5
| 2.5   | 2020-07-26 | Some really nice flavours appear in this range. A blend of somewhere around 2.3 - 2.5 and something darker would probably be pretty good
| 2.8   | 2020-07-26 | No noticable difference from 2.5
| 3.0   | 2020-07-05 | Pretty good tasting, not that many different taste notes though
| 3.5   | 2020-08-12 | Starting to taste charcoal
| **Blends** |  |  | 
| 2.4/3.0 | 2020-08-12 | K-logic classic | This blend works nicely
