| Roast | Date       | Grind | Comments |
|-------|------------|-------|----------
| 2.0   | 2020-07-05 |  | Not quite as good as 3.0
| 2.3   | 2020-08-12 |  | Similar to 2.5
| 2.5   | 2020-07-26 |  | Some really nice flavours appear in this range. A blend of somewhere around 2.3 - 2.5 and something darker would probably be pretty good
| 2.8   | 2020-07-26 |  | No noticable difference from 2.5
| 3.0   | 2020-07-05 |  | Pretty good tasting, not that many different taste notes though
| 3.5   | 2020-08-12 |  | Starting to taste charcoal
| **Blends** |  |  | 
| 2.4/3.0 | 2020-08-12 |  | This blend works nicely
