| 2020-11-03 | 1.4  |      | There are fruit & floral hints masked by green & sour flavours.<br>Potential is there for a better (probably slower to heat) roast profile
| 2020-07-05 | 2.0  |      | Not quite as good as 3.0
| 2020-11-03 | 2.1  |      | Not tasting any wow factor here<br>Not as much potential flavour here as below 2.0
| 2020-08-12 | 2.3  |      | Similar to 2.5
| 2020-07-26 | 2.5  |      | Some really nice flavours appear in this range.<br>A blend of somewhere around 2.3 - 2.5 and something darker<br>would probably be pretty good
| 2020-07-26 | 2.8  |      | No noticable difference from 2.5
| 2020-07-05 | 3.0  |      | Pretty good tasting, not that many different taste notes though
| 2020-08-12 | 3.5  |      | Starting to taste charcoal

| 2020-12-12 | 1.5  |      | Grassy notes somewhat hiding the floral notes, under developed

| 2020-11-28 | 3.2d |      | Weak tasting, little flavour at all<br>2nd cup was considerably better, not sure why,<br>may have been espresso machine heat<br>Would try going lighter though.<br>Taste will probably get better up to a week,<br> as some of the floral taste notes do start to appear to several days out from roast.
