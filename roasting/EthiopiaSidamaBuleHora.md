| 2020-11-03 | 1.4  |      | There are fruit & floral hints masked by green & sour flavours.<br>Potential is there for a better (probably slower to heat) roast profile
| 2020-12-28 | 1.6  | 25   | 
| 2020-07-05 | 2.0  |      | Not quite as good as 3.0
| 2020-11-03 | 2.1  |      | Not tasting any wow factor here<br>Not as much potential flavour here as below 2.0
| 2020-08-12 | 2.3  |      | Similar to 2.5
| 2020-07-26 | 2.5  |      | Some really nice flavours appear in this range.<br>A blend of somewhere around 2.3 - 2.5 and something darker<br>would probably be pretty good
| 2020-12-23 | 2.5  | 32   | 
| 2020-07-26 | 2.8  |      | No noticable difference from 2.5
| 2020-07-05 | 3.0  |      | Pretty good tasting, not that many different taste notes though

| 2020-11-28 | 3.2d |      | Weak tasting, little flavour at all<br>2nd cup was considerably better, not sure why,<br>may have been espresso machine heat<br>Would try going lighter though.<br>Taste will probably get better up to a week,<br> as some of the floral taste notes do start to appear to several days out from roast.

| 2020-12-20 | 3.9  | 20   | Charcoal and chocolate<br>I think this profile is worth playing with to get a lighter roast

| 2020-12-23 | 3.0  | 16   | Tasting good<br>sourness just starting to appear<br>No real floral notes, but possible slight nutty taste
