| Roast | Date       | Grind | Comments |
|-------|------------|-------|----------
| 1.5   | 2020-06-21 |  | A big green, would try 2.5
| 2.8   | 2020-07-19 |  | Similar flavours to 3.0, but probably better. Would be worth trying a blend of 3.0 with something maybe around 2.5
| 3.0   | 2020-06-21 |  | Red apple, maple syrup, red berries and sweet chocolate.<br>Qute nice, but not the taste we're looking for.
