| Roast | Date       | Grind | Comments |
|-------|------------|-------|----------
| 2.0   | 2020-06-06 |  | Too green, not good.
| 2.4   | 2020-09-26 |  | Similar to 2.5 and still not bad even as a single origin.
| 2.5   | 2020-09-20 |  | Seemed to taste fine (especially for light part of blend) despite 2.7 seeming to be too light.
| 2.7   | 2020-07-12 |  | For single origin too light, for blending probably not light enough.
| 3.0   | 2020-04-13 |  | <ul><li>Very Good tasting by itself</li><li>Good pontential for blending</li></ul>
| 3.1   | 2020-09-20 |  | On the edge of being over cooked.
| 3.3   | 2020-07-12 |  | Starting to taste chocolaty, quite strong.
| **Blends** |  |  | 
| 2.5/3.0 | 2020-09-20 |  | 50/50 Works well, but try going lighter and also a 2.6 with the lighter roast
